Crafter CMS is a modern content management platform for building digital experience applications using:

* SPA frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular
* AR/VR applications using A-Frame
* Native Mobile and Headless applications
* HTML5 Websites using Bootstrap or other HTML frameworks

Crafter is a dynamic CMS based on Git and supports DevOps processes for code and content. It is also a hybrid-headless, API-first (GraphQL, REST, in-process) CMS, and that allows developers to use their favorite UI frameworks and tools.

Crafter CMS differentiates itself from existing CMSs with its architecture: microservices-based, serverless, elastic and planet-wide scalability. To learn more, see the :ref:`architecture`.

This Manual introduces key concepts in Crafter CMS, presents the authoring and development environment, and provides operational and administrative considerations and procedures as well as a comprehensive reference section.
