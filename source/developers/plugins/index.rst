Crafter CMS plugins extend the CMS and provide the user additional functionality.  Plugins can be a single file or multiple files and directories.

Here are the available plugin types:

* Blueprints
* Studio Plugins

Crafter CMS currently has a `marketplace <https://marketplace.craftercms.org>`__ for users to submit their plugins for others to use or to find plugins that others have created. The Crafter Marketplace currently only supports the blueprint plugin type.  See :ref:`marketplace` for more information.
