allows authors to arrange and style content without needing to know HTML.

RTEs are more effective/productive for authors  when they are configured properly for the specific type of content the author is managing.  A properly and effectively configured RTE has the right styles, menu options and so on.

The Rich Text Editor (RTE) provides authors with a wide range of functionality for editing their text content. Icons, selection boxes, toolbar, and menus are provided for a WYSIWYG text-editing experience.

RTE can be configured to enable, disable, and extend the features available in the authoring components. To know how to use RTE features for authoring, see Use Rich Text Editor for authoring.
